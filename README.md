## How our website justifies the theme we have selected
The theme we chose for our project is Furniture and Decor. As per the theme we decided to create a website to where we can shop for these items. We created an product catalogue website, where furniture and decor items will be available for display and viewer can choose his required products. As furniture is broad category we divided the furniture into sub category like bedroom furniture and kitchen furniture and displayed them differently on the website. We displayed the home decor items as well. 
The website we create serves the theme and works a user friendly website for shopping of furniture and home decor products.

## Problems faced and they were resolved-

While making this website we ran into few problems.
1. Creating best UI is not easy. But we tried our level best to create an interactive and user friendly UI.
