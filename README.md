## How our website justifies the theme we have selected
The theme we chose for our project is Furniture and Decor. As per the theme we decided to create a website where one can shop for these items. We created an product catalogue website, where furniture and decor items will be available for display and viewers can choose their required products. As furniture is broad category we divided the furniture into sub categories like bedroom furniture and kitchen furniture and displayed them differently on the website. We displayed the home decor items as well. 
The website we create serves the theme and works as user friendly website for shopping of furniture and home decor products.
